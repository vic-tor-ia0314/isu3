This website is essentially all your financial needs in one. You are free to choose from five different options: Budgeting help, simple interest calculator, compound interest calculator,
appreciation/depreciation calculator, and a calculator for the difference between two rates. All of these can be useful in the real financial/economic world. This website is designed to be
easy to use and accessible. It was made with HTML for the web view, JavaScript for the functions and mechanisms, and CSS for the styling.
